title: I'm Just Done
---
I'm starting a new public [[Determining a Soul|Zettelkasten]]. Even if I write [[thousands of words a day]], all of a sudden, [[Sometimes, I Just Stare|I don't know what to write]]. This thing where you link words is something that I've experimented with before, but it has not been my default at all for [[Justifying Time Spent Writing|over two years of writing over 3.5 million words]]. I guess it should be as easy as just introducing oneself and one's interests and then just "[[We All Have Thoughts Like That|complicate]]" it by having each and every single interesting word either turn into a page itself or be a display name for a page to "complicate" that [[Overuse of Internal Links|hyperlinked]] [[phrase]] or [[word]]. I am using [[Quartz]] and [[Obsidian]], and I'm prepared to have it made online, given that I already have a personal website up on [[Cloudflare Pages]]. It is really just a matter of beginning this whole new [[Traveling|journey]] and then writing in the first [[spark]] that will [[trigger a myriad other sparks]]. It will [[chug on endlessly]]. Perhaps, this passage itself is a good starting [[note]].

[[Self-Responses to Self|I will just do as I please]], but this [[Atomic|atomic]] approach will certainly make me a lot more "official" with the way that I handle terms instead of a lot more blended and simultaneous where the meaning is [[Emergent|emergent]] rather than structured as per term, label, and definition. Nevertheless, there is no inherent tendency toward that approach, more so just a human psychological happening that coincides with the approach rather than any indication of the limitation of the Zettelkasten method, since structure is not damning, but interpretable and can easily find emergent meaning in the web of notes and find more fluid styles within the entire forest since it is not about linking each word and forcing the damning atom into the natural partitions of each constructed sentence, but about finding the connections that naturally dart out of the muck and jungly thickness of interconnected and layered thought processes.

This is the point of the display name. It damns the [[Self-Responses to Whole Corpus Itself|damner]].
