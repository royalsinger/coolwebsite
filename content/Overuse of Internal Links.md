I think that what I'm most afraid of as a Zettelkasten [[Superuser|user]] is what I believe to be the overuse of internal links. Like, at most 2 links per 50 words in a note. That is the limit for me. I believe much more in the quality of having it extend linearly rather than it being a uber-dense heap.

I mean 2 internal links per 50 words is already a fucking lot. My current index/starting page is already about to have 2.78 links per 50 words right now, being 360 words with 20 links. No need to go crazy.

I am not saying that the index page breaking my rules. I am proving that 2 links per 50 words is already a lot and good enough. Going beyond that is not a bad thing at all. I'm just saying that it might be better to keep the average at 2 per 50, since there is a point where it can feel like a self-convinced structure rather than something truly engaging with out-there ideas that bypass common mechanisms of "webbing". Basically, avoiding an incestuous system.

Nevertheless, incest can be a nice way to go deep into a system of mind (not just a state of mind). It is so self-filtering and absorbing in an echo chamberâ€“like way that it becomes its own compelling delusion, like a fiction web novel series with 1.5 million words. This does not contradict what I said. I am merely saying that it can go both ways.
