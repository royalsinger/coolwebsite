### Initialization

What's interesting is that in any small forum where you have to make an account to reply and post, it is easy to see how easily distinct you are. You just have to post and reply more than 5 times, and immediately, that user count of 2400 now looks so small, becasue you have surpassed probably 2350 of them.

### Extreme Example:

**ALERT!! EXTREME EXAMPLE!!! NOT INDICATIVE OF THE ORIGINAL FORMULA!!!**

This is especially the case when your skills make you fit the "superuser" role very easily, like a writer who spends much of his time online and interacting and lurking all around all kinds of online spaces. I am not just talking about any writer, but particularly one who is prolific enough to manage being active in a forum while having their own life and personal interests and such and one who is self- and meta-aware enough to think about themselves, everything they've known, how they speak, and more. To be this kind of person is rare and highly valuable, but even that is like seeking out a god among a pantheon of only a hundred gods who are so powerful yet still their own whimsical individuals.

Whimsy defines the elite.

When there are so few gods, you get to see the whimsy of each individual god in this "big shark small pond".

### Healing Pot (restore health by seeing the skeleton of what I'm saying)

To prevent misunderstanding, this is a structured formula of the argument:

- You just have to post and reply more than 5 times to surpass 2350 out of 2400.
- This phenomenon is **especially the case, but not strictly necessary or even something to mention at all,** when one fits the "superuser" role by virtue of skills.
- Just like a popular creator's entire community becoming the "establishment" of their personality and "whimsy," so is the superuser, like a pantheon of so few gods or a big shark in a small pond where any idiosyncracy becomes "gospel," like with an abusive father where those little mannerisms become highly meaningful.

### Additional

This is why in a Discord server where it's very close, tight, real-time, and highly sensitive, the super active-in-hashtag-general and uber-vocal moderators' voice and breath are not only very quirky, but highly determinative.

### I AM NOT THE SUPERUSER

I am not doing anything related to participating in a forum regularly. I am more so hypothesizing what would happen if someone with such skills would become a superuser and the more interesting concepts one can easily bring up or postulate from that kind of thought experiment.

### How It Differs from Making Blog Posts in an Algorithm

A forum superuser can be much stronger because they are directly engaging. A blog post can feel like some yapper in comparison. An idea is only compelling not only when it appeals to a common emotion, but when it feels like it came from someone who actually breathes the air we do. A god among us, not a blabberer in his closet (like I am in a sense, as of writing). We get "paid" in a forum. We "pay" bloggers in an algorithm.
