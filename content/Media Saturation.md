I pretend not to care, not to be affected. I watched *Naruto*, *Haikyu!!*, and *Kuroko no Basket* and the innumerable other stories of various formats like web comics and web novels.

I am so affected, yet I go on as if it doesn't affect me at all. Everything, I feel that I can barely muster up the strength to exist and to have all these memories that I've so easily forgotten to make space for current goals, activities, and interests.

It never ends, no matter how much I try to put it all together.

I wish that I could have stayed in that one thing and then just held it close forever. This saturation of endless stories only makes this feeling of loss even more painful. Just constant investment and loss. At one point, loss and this endlessness become facts of life.

I think that is what I feel.
